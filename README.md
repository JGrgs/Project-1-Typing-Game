### To Play

Taking turns, two players get to type as many words as they can before time runs out.

This is a game that requires speed and accuracy. However don't let the lack of that stop you from playing as you will develop both speed and accuracy by playing Type Fast.

To start, 

1. Click on "Start Game"
2. Then click on the input field that says "Type Word"
3. Start Typing

### Technology Used

HTML, CSS, JS and jQuery

HTML was used to build the structure of my game. Styled with CSS, the game looked prettier for end users. As for the fun part, playing the game, JS and jQuery were used for functionality.

### User Stories

As a player, I can enter my player name for easier tracking of turns.

As a player, I click a button to stand-in for dice-rolling, to find out what spot I will move to.

As a player, my game piece moves forward or backward depending on the action assigned to each space and the number I "rolled".

As a player, I can play a sub game if I land on a "challenge" space, so the game is more interesting.

As a player, I know when I've won because it is announced clearly.

### Approach

Due to lack of proper planning, I had to figure out my way through as I wrote code. Of course i started with my HTML and some basic CSS to have a visual representation of what I wanted. After that i moved on to JavaScript and jQuery to allow functionality to my game.

I tackled every part at a time for example, i needed a time count, i created that, i needed a score board i created that.. which made it much easier than thinking of the game as a whole and trying to figure it all out at once.

### Outstanding Challenges

Most challenging part was drying up my code.

Planning part was challenging as well.

In JavaScript it was challenging to make my words move at different speeds and change words once they pass the game display box.

Ability to resize my page without affecting styling.

### Future Work

As a developer player, I want syntax instead of words so i can practice my syntax.

As a player, I want an option to display my name.


As a player, I want to have the option to restart game at any time instead of refreshing the whole page.

As a player, I want the words that are being typed to get highlighted on the game display.
